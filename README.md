PRimate Interaction Movement and Enrichement

The PRIME devices are a series of devices that provide interaction capabilities to non-human primates and then give the option of providing reward for these interactions.

First example:

## B-PRIME

A "smart" rotating barrel which detects direction of rotational movement and provides feedback based on this input.
